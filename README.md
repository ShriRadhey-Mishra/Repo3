In this lab we performed and understood the working and the use of git submodules.

Using the command `git submodule add <git_link>` we can create a reference directory of the repository on the remote location. Using this reference directory we can access the content for our local repository.

In this lab particularly, we created 3 different repositories namely, Repo1, Repo2, and Repo3. In Repo1, we had a MAIN file which only had an HTML file. In Repo2 we have a CSS file and in Repo3 we have a JS file. In Repo1, we now use the submodule command to add Repo2 and Repo3 as the submodules, and access their content for our MAIN HTML file.
